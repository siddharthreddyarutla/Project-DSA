# Sliding window


The Sliding Window Technique is a powerful method used when you're working with contiguous subarrays or substrings in problems — especially when the goal is to find maximum, minimum, or a fixed condition (like a sum or distinct count) in O(n) time rather than O(n²).


### Use sliding window when:

- You're asked to process subarrays/substrings of a given length or within some condition.

- The data is contiguous (i.e., no gaps between elements).

- You're working with arrays or strings.

- You want to optimize from brute force O(n²) to O(n) time.

### Types of Sliding Window
- Fixed-size window → window of constant length k.

- Variable-size window → window grows and shrinks based on a condition.
