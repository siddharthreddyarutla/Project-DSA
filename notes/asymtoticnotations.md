### Order of Asymptotic Notations

Asymptotic notations are ordered based on their growth rates. Here is the order from best (fastest) to worst (slowest):


- O(1) – Constant Time

- O(log n) – Logarithmic Time

- O(n) – Linear Time

- O(n log n) – Linearithmic Time

- O(n²) – Quadratic Time

- O(n³) – Cubic Time

- O(2ⁿ) – Exponential Time

- O(n!) – Factorial Time
