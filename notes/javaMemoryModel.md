# Java memory model


Alright, letâ€™s do this like weâ€™re in a **Java architecture roundtable** â€” concise, structured, but deep enough so you can explain it back to someone else.

# ðŸ”¹ Java Memory Model (JMM)

### 1. **JVM Runtime Memory Areas**

When a Java program runs, the JVM divides memory like this:

* **Heap (shared)**

    * Stores **all objects** and **their instance variables**.
    * Divided into:

        * **Young Generation**

            * Eden space (new objects start here).
            * Survivor spaces (S0, S1 â†’ surviving objects get promoted).
        * **Old Generation (Tenured)** â†’ long-lived objects.
    * GC happens here.

* **Stack (per thread)**

    * Each thread has its own stack.
    * Stores **frames** for each method call.
    * Frame holds local variables, references, partial results.
    * Destroyed automatically when the method returns.

* **Method Area / Metaspace (shared)**

    * Stores class metadata (names, fields, methods, bytecode).
    * Stores **static variables** and **runtime constant pool**.
    * In Java 8+, **Metaspace** replaced **PermGen**.

* **PC Register**

    * Each thread has one, points to current executing instruction.

* **Native Method Stack**

    * For JNI/native calls.

### 2. **Concurrency Aspect of JMM**

JSR-133 defines **how threads interact with memory**:

* **happens-before rule** â†’ defines visibility/order guarantees.
* **volatile** â†’ guarantees visibility of updates.
* **synchronized/locks** â†’ guarantees atomicity + visibility.
* Each thread may cache variables; JMM rules ensure consistency.

---

# ðŸ”¹ Garbage Collection (GC)

### 1. **What GC Does**

* Finds objects in the **heap** that are no longer reachable (unreferenced).
* Reclaims memory so new objects can be created.

---

### 2. **GC Process**

1. **Mark** â€“ trace from GC Roots (local vars, static vars, threads, JNI refs) to mark reachable objects.
2. **Sweep** â€“ collect the unmarked (unreachable) ones.
3. **Compact** â€“ (optional) rearrange memory to reduce fragmentation.

---

### 3. **Types of GC Events**

* **Minor GC** â†’ Cleans Young Gen (fast, frequent).
* **Major GC (Full GC)** â†’ Cleans Old Gen + sometimes Young Gen (slower, bigger pause).

---

### 4. **Collectors**

* **Serial GC** â†’ Single-threaded (small apps).
* **Parallel GC** â†’ Multi-threaded, throughput oriented.
* **CMS (Concurrent Mark Sweep)** â†’ Low-pause, deprecated.
* **G1 (Garbage First)** â†’ Default since Java 9, balances latency/throughput.
* **ZGC / Shenandoah** â†’ Modern, low-latency, for very large heaps.

# ðŸ”¹ Example Code Walkthrough

```java
class Demo {
    static int count = 0;        // Method Area / Metaspace
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        int x = 10;              // Stack (local var in main frame)
        Person p = new Person(); // p â†’ stack reference, object â†’ heap
        count++;                 // static var â†’ Metaspace
    }
}
```

* When `main` ends:

    * `x` and `p` disappear from the stack.
    * If no other references to the `Person` object exist â†’ eligible for GC.

---

âœ… **In summary:**

* **Heap** â†’ Objects, GC territory.
* **Stack** â†’ Local variables, per-thread.
* **Metaspace** â†’ Class info + static vars.
* **GC** â†’ Reclaims unreachable heap memory (Young/Old gen) using collectors like G1.
* **JMM rules** â†’ Make sure multi-threaded code sees consistent values.
