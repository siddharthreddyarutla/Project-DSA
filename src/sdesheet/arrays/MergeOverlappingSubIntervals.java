  /**
   * Problem Statement: Given an array of intervals, merge all the overlapping intervals and
   * return an array of non-overlapping intervals.
   * Examples
   * Example 1:
   * Input: intervals=[[1,3],[2,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
   * Output: [[1,6],[8,10],[15,18]]
   * Explanation: Since intervals [1,3] and [2,6] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,6]
   * intervals.
   * <p>
   * Example 2:
   * Input: [[1,4],[4,5]]
   * Output: [[1,5]]
   * Explanation: Since intervals [1,4] and [4,5] are overlapping we can merge them to form [1,5].
